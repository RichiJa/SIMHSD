# Disclaimer
- please dont use long directories i.e. lots of files stacked on top of each other like a digital matroshka puppet
- everybody has his own unique branch for experiments and such
- the main branch should mainly be used to share stable models and meaningfull output as well as eventual plots
- this ReadMe includes a todo list which can and should be updated by everybody
- we can switch language to german if you want to :)
- if you want to add to the ReadMe, please use *Markdown* syntax; here is a cheat sheet: https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/
